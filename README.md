TimeFeed is a decentralized web3 social media platform that incentivizes user engagement. If a user likes someone's post, their post stays on the main page for 1 more minute and if a user dislikes it deducts 1 minute out of the post. But for liking or disliking user has to spend 1 $TIME (native token of TimeFeed). An average time for every category is calculated and if a post in a category stays up more than avg all the users who liked would get incentivized.

In addition, original posters have an option to cash out their post time for $TIME tokens, but this will decrease the number of minutes on the post depending on how much time they exchange for money. As a user acquisition strategy, each user is provided with 1 free upvote/downvote per post.
